# cub3D
You must create a “realistic” 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first-person perspective. You have to create this representation using the Ray-Casting principles mentioned earlier.

Project made in a week by jgourlin and gsap. 4/5 bonus were made (collision, minimap, doors and sprite).
